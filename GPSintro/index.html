<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since people began walking the earth, they have sought out features of the landscape that would provide goals to reach during their journey. Early people may have shared this information with friends and relatives, giving them the information needed to get to a particular place. Eventually they turned towards the heavens for guidance, using their physical relationship to the stars as a means to crossing land and sea. Still today we are looking up, or at least our equipment is, for guidance as to where we are and where we are going. Today that guidance comes from the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>
<h2 id="gps-history">GPS History</h2>
<p>The initial concept of GPS began to take form soon after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Some scientists and engineers realized that radio transmissions from a satellite in a well-defined orbit could indicate the position of a receiver on the ground. This knowledge resulted in the U.S. Navy’s development and use of the “Transit” system in the 1960’s. This system, however, proved to be cumbersome to use and limited in terms of positioning accuracy.</p>
<p>Starting in the mid-1970s the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) began the construction of today’s GPS and has funded, operated, and maintained control of the system it developed. Eventually $12 billion dollars would take GPS from concept to completion. Full Operational Capacity (FOC) of GPS was reached on July 17, 1995.</p>
<h2 id="gps-applications">GPS Applications</h2>
<p>The GPS system was developed to meet military needs of the Department of Defense, but new ways to use its capabilities are continually being found. The system has been used in aircraft and ships, but there are many other ways to benefit from GPS.</p>
<p>During the construction of the tunnel under the English Channel, British and French crews started digging from opposite ends, relying on GPS receivers situated outside the tunnel to check their position along the way and make sure they met exactly in the middle. Another GPS application area is in vehicle tracking, where GPS-equipped vehicles use receivers to monitor their location at all times. GPS is also helping to save lives. Many police, fire, and emergency medical services are using GPS receivers to determine the police car, fire truck or ambulance nearest to an emergency, enabling the quickest possible response to life-or-death situations [Aerospace, 1997].
Automobile manufacturers are offering moving-map displays guided by GPS receivers as an option on new vehicles. Several rental car companies are also demonstrating GPS-equipped vehicles that give directions to drivers on display screens and through synthesized voice instructions.</p>
<p>Mapping and surveying companies are using GPS extensively. In the field of wildlife management endangered species such as Montana elk and Mojave Desert tortoises are being fitted with GPS receivers and tiny transmitters to help determine population distribution patterns and possible sources of diseases [Aerospace, 1997].</p>
<p>GPS-equipped balloons are monitoring holes in the ozone layer over the polar regions, and air quality is being monitored using GPS receivers. Buoys tracking major oil spills also transmit data using GPS.</p>
<h2 id="project-aim">Project Aim</h2>
<p>The idea behind this project was to design a simple car navigation system for Malta. Although the country is small and one easily finds the way throughout the streets, it is not always the case for foreigners. The principle was to have some sort of map continuously being displayed in the vehicle, with the vehicle’s position updated in real-time by means of the Global Positioning System. A further aim for the project was to display the street name the vehicle currently stood in. Since from the 1st of May, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) decided to remove the GPS signal degradation, known as Selective Availability (SA), the task of deciding the most probable street name has become a simple problem. With the removal of SA, the accuracy of the GPS positioning has improved from approximately 100m down to 20m and thus the probability of displaying the correct street name is relatively high when compared to the system with SA on.</p>
<h2 id="thesis-organisation">Thesis Organisation</h2>
<p>This dissertation is divided into ten chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 gives a background on the various types of GPS receivers available as well as the basic theory of operation of the actual GPS receiver. The method by which the GPS receiver calculates the position is also discussed. Chapter 3 describes the SiGEM   GPS module, as well as its communications protocol over the serial port. </p>
<p>Chapter 5 deals with the coordinate conversion process, which is needed to accurately display the receiver’s position on the map. Map projection transformations and datum conversions are described in some detail. </p>
<p>Chapters 4, 6, 7 and 8 deal mainly with the actual construction of the hardware needed to obtain a working system, together with the appropriate block diagrams. Namely, chapter 4 describes the interfacing used between the GPS module and the PC to obtain the GPS data in readable form. This was done in order to be able to perform various statistical tests on the collected data. Chapter 6 describes the GPS data logger, which was used to log GPS data while the vehicle was moving, and chapter 7 describes the different types of display technologies available on the market, which can be used in an automobile. These different display types were then briefly compared. Chapter 8 details the interfacing, which was needed to drive the display chosen for this application. A description of the display controller is given in block diagram form together with the necessary signals needed to drive the display.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 describes in detail the statistical analysis which was carried out on the data obtained from a stationary receiver, together with the results obtained from a mobile GPS receiver while passing through various streets in Malta. Finally, chapter 10 describes some improvements which can be done to the system and concludes the dissertation with a few comments.</p></div>
